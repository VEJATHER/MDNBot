This is a chatbot built using the [Claudia-Bot-builder](https://claudiajs.com/claudia-bot-builder.html) framework for [Slack](https://slack.com/). It allows you to query information from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) or get a random article using slack commands.

You will have to setup Amazon Lambda functions and a slack app to be able to run it in your slack client.
